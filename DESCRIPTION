Description: The biomarker data set by Vermeulen et al. (2009)
    <doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70154-8> is provided. The data
    source, however, is by Ruijter et al. (2013)
    <doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.08.011>. The original data set may
    be downloaded from
    <https://medischebiologie.nl/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/qpcrdatamethods.zip>.
    This data set is for a real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction
    (PCR) experiment that comprises the raw fluorescence data of 24,576
    amplification curves. This data set comprises 59 genes of interest and 5
    reference genes. Each gene was assessed on 366 neuroblastoma complementary
    DNA (cDNA) samples and on 18 standard dilution series samples (10-fold
    5-point dilution series x 3 replicates + no template controls (NTC) x 3
    replicates).
