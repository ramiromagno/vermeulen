Description: The 'biomarker' data set by 'Vermeulen' (2009)
    <doi:10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70154-8> but as provided by 'Ruijter' (2013)
    <doi:10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.08.011>. This data set is for a real-time
    quantitative 'PCR' experiment that comprises the raw fluorescence data of
    24,576 amplification curves. This data set comprises 59 genes of interest
    and 5 reference genes. Each gene was assessed on 366 'neuroblastoma' 'cDNA'
    samples and on 18 dilution series samples (10-fold 5-point dilution series
    x 3 replicates + 'NTC' x 3 replicates).
